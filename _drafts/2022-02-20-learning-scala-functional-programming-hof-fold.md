title: "Learning Scala as a Python Programmer: Folding Patterns for Functional Data Pipelines"
description: "Sixth post for a series of posts on functional programming for data engineering"
excerpt: "In my previous post on functional programming features for control flow, I explored the concept of functional data structures and how they enable us to design functional data pipelines that are reproducible at scale. In this post, we will explore the concept of fold in functional programming and how folding can be used as a form of functional iteration when designing functional data pipelines on recursive data structures."
