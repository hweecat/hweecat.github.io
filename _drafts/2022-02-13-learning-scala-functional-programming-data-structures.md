title: "Learning Scala as a Python Programmer: Functional Data Structures for Reproducible Data Pipelines"
description: "Fifth post for a series of posts on functional programming for data engineering"
excerpt: "In my previous post on functional programming features for control flow, I explored the map-filter-reduce trio of higher-order functions and how they can be used in designing functional data pipelines. In this post, we will explore the concept of functional data structures and how they enable us to design functional data pipelines that are reproducible at scale."
