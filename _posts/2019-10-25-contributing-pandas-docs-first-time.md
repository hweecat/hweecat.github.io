title: "Contributing to pandas documentation for the first time - and lessons learnt"
description: "A work-in-progress developer log on contributing documentation for a popular open-source project for the first time."
excerpt: To mark my first year as a data engineer, I started thinking "How can I contribute back to the community that enables my work for the past year?" I came across an open issue on documentation for pandas, a popular open-source Python library for data analysis and manipulation, and decided to give it a try. Here's a work-in-progress developer log on the lessons learnt through contributing documentation to an open-source Python library for the first time - and how contributing to open-source projects is not as scary as it might seem to be.
