title: "Contributing to pandas documentation for the first time - and lessons learnt"
description: "A work-in-progress developer log on contributing documentation for a popular open-source project for the first time."
excerpt: To mark my first year as a data engineer, I started thinking "How can I contribute back to the community that enables my work for the past year?" I came across an open issue on documentation for pandas, a popular open-source Python library for data analysis and manipulation, and decided to give it a try. Here's a work-in-progress developer log on the lessons learnt through contributing documentation to an open-source Python library for the first time - and how contributing to open-source projects is not as scary as it might seem to be.

To mark my first year as a data engineer, I started thinking: 

"How can I contribute back to the community that enables my work for the past year?"

I came across an open issue on documentation for pandas, a popular open-source Python library for data analysis and manipulation, and decided to give it a try. Here's a work-in-progress developer log on the lessons learnt through contributing documentation for an open-source Python library for the first time - and how contributing to open-source projects is not as scary as it might seem to be.

## Some background about myself



### A bit about pandas



### Raising my hand for a docs issue


## Getting started with my pull request


## Lessons from contributing documentation


### Lesson 1: Read the style guides and contributing guide

(something about PEP8 and PEP257, performing checks before pushing changes to remote)

### Lesson 2: Git for version control is best learnt by doing

(that's what Hacktoberfest is for!)

### Lesson 2.1: Learn the difference between `git merge` and `git rebase`

(difference between `git merge` and `git rebase` is very important - choosing which one to use depends on whether you are working in a small project team or a large team of contributors)

### Lesson 2.2: For cleaner commit histories, `git rebase -i HEAD~n` and squash

### Lesson 2.3: `git push -f` responsibly

(when you are the only one working on the branch and you accidentally pushed your changes to your remote repo without performing the checks)

### Lesson 3: Documentation is highly valued - and doesn't require coding

(many open-source projects welcome improvements to the documentation, and you don't need to be an expert in coding to contribute to open source)

### Lesson 4: If you face any challenges, feel free to ask for help!

(I've received helpful advice from the maintainers on how to improve my docs, and what to do when I messed up my Git commands. Open source project maintainers are also human and are willing to help first-time contributors make their first contributions to open source!)
