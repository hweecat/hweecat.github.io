## Speaking at Tech Events: Why?

I've attended tech events and conferences since 2018, and I've learnt a lot from attending the sessions. As I sat amongst the audience watching in awe at the speakers and panelists on stage delivering their talks and speeches with confidence and style, I thought:

> What would it take for me to be up on this stage as a speaker?

I'm more of an introvert in nature, and extensive networking during tech events can get very draining for me even though I do love interacting with new people. Having to find various means to start a conversation only to have it fall flat on people also adds on a lot of pressure on me, and consecutive occurences do drain me severely of energy such that I need to take breaks from attending tech events. Moreover, I tend to get really nervous when speaking in front of an audience - unlike music performance whereby it is natural not to maintain eye contact with the audience while getting your whole self (body + mind) immersed in the music, public speaking requires a lot more attention on eye contact and body language.

In short, I'm not a natural when it comes to speaking in front of an audience. Still, I want to speak at tech events for the following reasons:

1. Build my personal brand and raise my profile in the local tech community
2. Gain experience in public speaking
3. Pay it forward to the local tech community

## Getting Started

In end January, I attended a panel discussion on "Getting Started with Public Speaking" by Women Who Code Singapore. It was at this event where I met three of the panelists who would turn out to be pivotal in my speaking journey - Renu Yadav (Women Who Code Singapore), Chen Huijing (SingaporeCSS) and Michael Cheng (JuniorDevSG).

As it turns out, Huijing also organizes Global CFP Diversity Day in Singapore and was promoting the event (as well as her meetup SingaporeCSS, which always needs speakers). I originally intended to attend another tech event on the same day, but woke up late and decided at the last minute to attend Global CFP Diversity Day - just to see what it was about.

During the Global CFP Diversity Day workshop, we need to write a speaker profile and work through a whole list of questions on crafting a CFP submission. Uh okay, what can a data engineer who is barely 5 months into the role write or speak about that would impress the CFP panel? Wait what, I have to tell Huijing about myself?

(insert more neverending questions that sprouted after Global CFP Diversity Day)

As it turns out, role-related pains/complaints/angst can be a source of inspiration for talk proposals. I'll talk about that in the later part of this post.

## My First Time Speaking at a Tech Event

For my first-ever public tech talk, I was initially thinking of starting small by speaking at relatively more "beginner-friendly" meetups such as JuniorDevSG Code and Tell. While I submitted my first CFP to a conference, I was prepared to submit CFPs to multiple conferences and meetups until I receive a talk acceptance.

Surprisingly, my first CFP submission on How to Make Your Data Processing Faster was accepted by end June before I had a meetup talk scheduled. I needed to practice my conference talk at a meetup where I could get relevant feedback fast, and I was told that there was a long waiting list for speaker slots at JuniorDevSG Code and Tell; hence, I booked a speaking slot with Martin for the Python User Group Singapore August 2019 meetup to practice a key portion of my conference talk. I was informed that the meetup would be held at the new Zendesk office at Marina One and the typical turnout was around 50-60 people.

On the day itself, the actual turnout was over 100 people - way more than I expected, especially since I have been relatively low-key about the talk, even removing any reference to my gender in the speaker profile. There were technical issues, my "tech-y" jokes and Spark references kinda fell flat on the audience, and there was a slight overrun. I thought I kinda messed up my talk, so I was pleasantly surprised when a few people in the audience approached me off-stage to thank me and give positive feedback for the talk.

Key lesson learnt: You are better than you think you are.
