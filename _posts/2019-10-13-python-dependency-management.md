Dependency management is important, as packages depend on versions of other core packages in order to run as intended. Typically in a Python project, dependencies are downloaded using a requirements.txt file, which lists the packages and their dependencies as a flat file. While the package versions are included in the requirements.txt file, the dependency relationships are not explicitly stated. Determining the dependency relationships between packages using requirements.txt often requires "reverse engineering" in the form of tracing the dependencies of each installed package and figuring out why pip installed certain packages (since pip does the work of resolving package dependencies when installing packages).

While searching for ways to resolve the multiple requirements.txt files from my colleages within a team project, I stumbled across `pipdeptree`, a command-line utility for displaying installed Python packages in the form of a dependency tree. The output is displayed in a tree-based format instead of a flat list, showing the dependency relationships between installed Python packages and their associated dependencies.

## Using pipdeptree for dependency management

To install pipdeptree, use the following command:

```python
pip install pipdeptree
```

or, if you prefer to use conda:

```python
conda install -c conda-forge pipdeptree
```

In order to be able to manage dependencies within virtual environments, `pipdeptree` has to be installed within each individual virtual environment. If you are starting a new virtual environment for a project and would like to use `pipdeptree` for dependency management, you would have to install `pipdeptree` in that new virtual environment.
