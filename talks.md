I stumbled into public speaking when I attended Singapore Global CFP Diversity Day in March 2019, and subsequently got my first CFP submission accepted a few months later. I'm still pretty new to delivering talks in public, so I consider myself a work-in-progress speaker who is constantly learning from the audience.
