I stumbled into public speaking when I attended Singapore Global CFP Diversity Day in March 2019, and subsequently got my first CFP submission accepted a few months later. Since then, I have delivered more than 10 talks at various tech conferences regionally and internationally. As I can get pretty self-conscious when delivering talks in public (especially when talks are now remote), I consider myself a work-in-progress speaker who is constantly learning from the audience.
