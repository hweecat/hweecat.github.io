This is where I keep track of my tech goals every year to keep myself on track in my tech career journey.

## 2023 Goals

My goal for 2023 is to:

1. Get back to delivering talks in at least 1 meetup by June 2023 and 1 tech conference by September 2023.

2. Block out a weekend every month to write a tech post that documents my learning journey - sharing with a wider audience would be a bonus.

3. Start generating content ideas that goes beyond technical implementation by reading and actively taking notes interesting things I read.
    - Part of technical leadership is about being aware of the bigger picture and being a better human. This is one of the ways I intend to act upon my mentor's advice to build up my expert power.

4. Continue learning functional programming through writing more Scala code and documenting my learnings through my [functional programming series](https://hweecat.github.io/tag/functional-programming/)
    - This is a longer-term project that I intend to shape gradually on the side, to bridge the learning gap for data practitioners who would like to learn Scala for functional programming.

5. Monetize my speaking engagements / expertise through designing a data engineering course (and other side hustles)

## 2022 Goals

My goal for 2022 is to:

1. ~~Attain my seniority and become a Senior Data Engineer~~
    - Update 2022-08-27: As of 2022-08-08, I am a Senior Data Engineer.

2. Speak at PyCon 2022 (Might as well give it another try, right?)
    - Rejected. :sadface:

3. Deliver talks in 2 tech conferences locally and internationally
    - Pivoted away to focus on my career transtiion.

4. ~~Pass AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialty exam by March 2022~~
    - Update 2022-08-27: Passed as of 2022-05-07.

5. Enhance my Github portfolio with a meaningful side project that demonstrates end-to-end data / machine learning solutions
    - Update 2022-08-27: I am currently working on a meaningful side project that demonstrates end-to-end data solutions for a non-profit. Not sure if the code repository (if any) would be hosted on Github though.

6. Continue learning functional programming through writing more Scala code and documenting my learnings through my [functional programming series](https://hweecat.github.io/tag/functional-programming/)

7. Write a tech post every month to document my learning journey and share with a wider audience
    - Update 2022-08-27: Due to turbulent changes in my personal and professional life, I would have to cut down on documenting my learning journey publicly for the time being.

8. Make regular weekly updates to [my TIL blog](https://datadiaries.dev), which is built using [Pelican](https://getpelican.com)
    - Similar to above; currently using Notion for quick note-taking on the go and still trying to find a suitable TIL approach that works for me.

9. Monetize my speaking engagements / expertise through designing a data engineering course (and other side hustles)

## 2021 Goals

My goal for 2021 is to:

1. Speak at PyCon 2021 (I can dream, right?)
    - Standby :sadface:

2. Deliver talks in 4 tech conferences locally and internationally
    - Tally: 4 (2 pre-recorded, 2 virtual live)
    - Update 2021-10-31: **Goal achieved** - With my last live talk at PyData Global 2021 and the next conference (PyCon APAC 2021) being a pre-recorded talk, I have wrapped up on tech speaking for year 2021 and will be planning for year 2022.

3. ~~Pass CKAD exam by August 2021~~
    - [I passed CKAD!](https://www.credly.com/badges/01b47a0e-d05c-4b9b-8af0-7847bc260f55/public_url)

4. Enhance my Github portfolio with meaningful side projects that demonstrate end-to-end data solutions
    - I attempted...[this functional data pipelines repo for Python 3.10](https://github.com/hweecat/python-functional-data-pipelines)

5. Learn functional programming through writing Scala code and documenting my learnings
    - Update 2021-12-31: Completed first two articles for my [functional programming series](https://hweecat.github.io/tag/functional-programming/)

6. Write tech posts at least once a month to document my learning journey and (hopefully) share with more people
    - Update 2021-12-31: I tried, but burnout and imposter syndrome got the better of me. :sadface:

7. Make regular weekly updates to [my TIL blog](https://datadiaries.dev), which is built using [Pelican](https://getpelican.com)
    - Update 2021-12-31: Same as above :sadface:

8. ~~Make at least 4 Pull Requests on open-source projects~~
    - Abandoned due to multiple competing commitments in advancing my tech career

    - Update 2021-12-30: Made a tiny first step! Stay tuned for more updates.

## 2020 Goals

My goal for 2020 is to:

1. ~~Speak at a headliner tech conference in Asia~~

2. ~~Speak at a tech conference outside of Asia (preferably in Europe and/or North America)~~ (and hope I do not embarrass my country on the international stage)
    - Update 2020-05-21: I will be speaking at [EuroPython 2020](https://ep2020.europython.eu/) Online, which is on 23 - 26 July 2020.
