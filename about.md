Hello! My name is Chin Hwee, and my day job is a Data Engineer at a government-linked corporation in Singapore (so technically ah-gong keeps me off the streets). 

My background is not in Computer Science (I could have switched majors, but I really love studying aerodynamics and aircraft propulsion too), but I've been relying on writing codes on-and-off to get myself through coursework since 9 years ago. I enjoy writing code and making my codes work, 'cos bugs are common and solving bugs helps keep my potentially-dangerous perfectionistic thoughts at bay.

### More Information

My personal interests range from aviation to music. I am also interested in photography, travel, and innovation.

I'm currently learning how to make my Python codes run faster so that I can have more time to focus on machine learning. I enjoy having deep-dive discussions on how to make the world a better place through technology and human intelligence.

My goal for 2019 is to:
1. Speak at a tech meetup (and hope my reputation in the tech community does not go down the drain) - Update 2019-07-28: I have booked a speaking slot with the friendly folks from [https://pugs.org.sg][Python User Group Singapore] - more details on the meetup will be released in August 2019!
2. Build up my Github portfolio
3. Write more tech posts to document my learning journey and (hopefully) share with more people
4. Speak at a tech conference so that I can share what I've learnt with even more people - Update 2019-07-28: I will be speaking at [https://asia.womenwhocode.dev/][Women Who Code Connect Asia 2019] in Singapore on 31st August 2019. See you there!
