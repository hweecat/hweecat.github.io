Hello! My name is Chin Hwee, and my day job is a Senior Data Engineer at a <s>government-linked corporation in Singapore (so technically ah-gong keeps me off the streets)</s> <s>fintech company that helps migrant workers stay in touch with their loved ones back home (so technically my work can potentially make the world a better place for them to live in)</s> nascent team in a superapp company that aims to deliver financial inclusion in one of the world's fastest-growing regions.

While my background is not in Computer Science and is an interdisciplinary blend of Computational Science, Engineering and Business (I could have switched majors, but I really love studying aerodynamics and aircraft propulsion too), I've been writing code on-and-off to get myself through coursework since more than 10 years ago. I enjoy writing code and making my codes work, 'cos bugs are common and solving bugs helps keep my potentially-dangerous perfectionistic thoughts at bay.

### More Information

My personal interests range from aviation to music and finance (but sadly COVID-19 sent aviation into a long winter which triggered my pivot into fintech). I am also interested in photography, travel, and innovation.

I'm currently <s>struggling with</s> learning:
1. how to write well-functioning functional programming codes in Scala so that I can run Spark jobs in their native language
2. how to make my Python codes run faster so that I can have more time to focus on machine learning
3. how to design scalable, highly-resilient and reliable data and AI (including machine learning) workflows that supercharge my decision-making superpowers beyond work.

I enjoy having deep-dive discussions on how to make the world a better place through technology and human intelligence. I also have a [resume](https://hweecat.github.io/resume), if you're looking to hire someone for data science, AI, data engineering, and machine learning operations.

I keep track of my tech goals every year to keep myself on track in my tech career journey, check them out [here](https://hweecat.github.io/goals).

My top-priority goal in 2026 is to become a Lead/Staff Data and Machine Learning Operations Engineer, after a turbulent career journey as a Senior Data Engineer for the past 3+ years. Leveling matters a lot for me as a data professional who takes my career progression seriously, as ["titles make a world of difference in establishing credibility" in my tech career](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-seniority-roller-coaster/) and are directly tied to future compensation, financial outcomes and scope of autonomy. If you are a data professional who would like a candid discussion on career progression in tech, let's connect!

### Talks

I stumbled into public speaking when I attended Singapore Global CFP Diversity Day in March 2019, and subsequently got my first CFP submission accepted a few months later. Since then, I have spoken at various meetups and conferences locally and internationally on a variety of topics including data processing, parallel and asynchronous programming, and contributing to the open source community.

One of my speaking goals in 2025 is to monetize my speaking engagements. Let's discuss how I can add value to your next event in 2025!

Topics that I speak on:

1. Data Processing and Dimensional Data Modeling in the Modern Data Stack
2. Parallel and Asynchronous Programming for Data Science
3. Machine Learning Operations in Digital Banking
4. Building Your Tech Career like a Business
5. Emotional Regulation for Technical Leaders
