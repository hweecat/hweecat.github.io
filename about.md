Hello! My name is Chin Hwee, and my day job is a Data Engineer at a government-linked corporation in Singapore (so technically ah-gong keeps me off the streets).

My background is not in Computer Science (I could have switched majors, but I really love studying aerodynamics and aircraft propulsion too), but I've been relying on writing codes on-and-off to get myself through coursework since 9 years ago. I enjoy writing code and making my codes work, 'cos bugs are common and solving bugs helps keep my potentially-dangerous perfectionistic thoughts at bay.

### More Information

My personal interests range from aviation to music. I am also interested in photography, travel, and innovation.

I'm currently learning how to make my Python codes run faster so that I can have more time to focus on machine learning. I enjoy having deep-dive discussions on how to make the world a better place through technology and human intelligence.

My goal for 2019 is to:

1. ~~Speak at a tech meetup~~ (and hope my reputation in the tech community does not go down the drain)
    - Update 2019-09-01: **Goal achieved** - I did my [first-ever public tech meetup talk]((https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Python-User-Group/events/263765155/)) on 27th August 2019, and over 100 people attended my talk (a larger turnout than usual). Reflection on talk [here](https://hweecat.github.io/talk_parallel-programming-python).

2. Build up my Github portfolio
3. Write more tech posts to document my learning journey and (hopefully) share with more people
4. ~~Speak at a tech conference so that I can share what I've learnt with even more people~~
    - Update 2019-08-22: I will be speaking at [Women Who Code CONNECT Asia 2019](https://asia.womenwhocode.dev/) in Singapore on 31st August 2019. See you there!
    - Update 2019-09-01: **Goal achieved** - I delivered my first-ever conference talk on 31st August 2019. Reflection on talk [here](https://hweecat.github.io/talk_how-to-make-your-data-processing-faster)
    
5. Make my first Pull Request on an open-source project

### Talks

I stumbled into public speaking when I attended Singapore Global CFP Diversity Day in March 2019, and subsequently got my first CFP submission accepted a few months later. I'm still pretty new to delivering talks in public, so I consider myself a work-in-progress speaker who is constantly learning from the audience.
