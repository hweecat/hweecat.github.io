Hello! My name is Chin Hwee, and my day job is a Data Engineer at a government-linked corporation in Singapore (so technically ah-gong keeps me off the streets).

My background is not in Computer Science (I could have switched majors, but I really love studying aerodynamics and aircraft propulsion too), but I've been relying on writing codes on-and-off to get myself through coursework since 9 years ago. I enjoy writing code and making my codes work, 'cos bugs are common and solving bugs helps keep my potentially-dangerous perfectionistic thoughts at bay.

### More Information

My personal interests range from aviation to music. I am also interested in photography, travel, and innovation.

I'm currently learning how to make my Python codes run faster so that I can have more time to focus on machine learning. I enjoy having deep-dive discussions on how to make the world a better place through technology and human intelligence.

My goal for 2020 is to:

1. ~~Speak at a headliner tech conference in Asia~~
    - Update 2019-01-16: **Goal achieved** - I will be speaking at [FOSSASIA Summit 2020](https://summit.fossasia.org/) in Singapore, which is on 19 - 22 March 2020. More details on discount code for community and social event tickets will be released when I receive the details.

2. Speak at a tech conference outside of Asia (preferably in Europe and/or North America)
3. Deliver talks in at least 4 tech conferences locally and internationally
4. Enhance my Github portfolio
5. Write more tech posts to document my learning journey and (hopefully) share with more people
6. Make more regular updates to [my TIL blog](https://datadiaries.commons.host), which is built using [Pelican](https://getpelican.com)
7. Make at least 4 Pull Requests on open-source projects

My goals for 2019 was to:

1. ~~Speak at a tech meetup~~ (and hope my reputation in the tech community does not go down the drain)
    - Update 2019-09-01: **Goal achieved** - I did my [first-ever public tech meetup talk]((https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Python-User-Group/events/263765155/)) on 27th August 2019, and over 100 people attended my talk (a larger turnout than usual). Reflection on talk [here](https://hweecat.github.io/talk_parallel-programming-python).

2. Build up my Github portfolio
    - I uploaded more repositories on Github, filed issues on BigDataX workshop repos, and even made a pull request on pandas-dev!

3. Write more tech posts to document my learning journey and (hopefully) share with more people
4. ~~Speak at a tech conference so that I can share what I've learnt with even more people~~
    - Update 2019-08-22: I will be speaking at [Women Who Code CONNECT Asia 2019](https://asia.womenwhocode.dev/) in Singapore on 31st August 2019. See you there!
    - Update 2019-09-01: **Goal achieved** - I delivered my first-ever conference talk on 31st August 2019. Reflection on talk [here](https://hweecat.github.io/talk_how-to-make-your-data-processing-faster)
    
5. ~~Make my first Pull Request on an open-source project~~
    - Update 2020-01-03: **Goal achieved** My first pull request on pandas 1.0 was merged!

### Talks

I stumbled into public speaking when I attended Singapore Global CFP Diversity Day in March 2019, and subsequently got my first CFP submission accepted a few months later. Since then, I have spoken at various meetups and conferences locally and internationally on a variety of topics including data processing, parallel and asynchronous programming and contributing to the open source community.

One of my speaking goals in 2020 is to speak at a tech conference outside of Asia. Invite me to your conference in 2020!
